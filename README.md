# Overwatch Map Planner

This is a local, browser-based tool for planning Overwatch strategies using drag-and-drop icons, paths, and visual aids.
In order to open, download and unzip onto your desktop. Afterwards, double click on "index.html"

How to use:
Loading the application will place you on Watch Point Gibraltar. Select "NO" Or "Cancel" on the pop-up menu.
Right-clicking on the canvas will pull up a Radial Menu that you can use to place icons, shapes, lines, and draw.
At the top, the drop-down menus for map selection, hero selection and ultimate selection are present. On load, it will preset Zenyatta. You will need to change the selection to another hero then back to Ana if you wish to place Ana. Same thing with the Map, and Ultimate. This will be addressed in a later patch.
Utilize + and - for zooming in and out of the map, or the buttons at the top.
Scroll wheel or arrow keys will traverse you through the map. 
To save your current animations and drawings, press "save"
To load your saved animations and drawings, press "Load"
After placing an Icon, right-clicking it will allow you to draw an animation path which will open up an option box on the right side.


Updates

Added zoom out on initial load
Added save option before switching maps
Added alphabetical organization of drop down menu
Added "delete icon" and "delete path" on right click of icon
Deleting icon will now delete path
Changing maps deletes paths, icons and lines
>>>CURRENT ISSUE<<< 
-On load, drop down menu will say "Hanamura" but load gibraltar. This will prevent map change until Gibraltar is selected in the drop down menu.
- On load, prompt for map change save option appears, just ignore for now

>>> ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED IN NEXT PATCH<<<
