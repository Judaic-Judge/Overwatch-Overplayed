# Overwatch Map Planner

This is a local, browser-based tool for planning Overwatch strategies using drag-and-drop icons, paths, and visual aids.

##  How to Use

1. **Extract the ZIP file** (if you downloaded it as a zip).
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser.
   - Double-click it, or right-click and choose "Open with" → your preferred browser.
3. **Use the toolbar** at the top to:
   - Select a map
   - Place heroes, ultimates, or health packs
   - Draw lines, circles, and squares
   - Create animation paths with Field of View visualizations
   - Zoom and pan the map
   - Move or delete elements
   - Animate icons along defined paths

##  Folder Structure

├── index.html # Main entry point (open this in your browser)
├── maps/ # Map image files (e.g., Watchpoint Gibraltar)
├── textures/
│ └── icons/ # Hero icons, ultimates, health packs


##  Requirements

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No internet connection required
- No installation or additional software needed

##  Notes

- Ensure that the folder structure is preserved — images must remain inside `maps/` and `textures/icons/` or they won't load properly.
- Max of 10 animation paths can be created per map setup.
- All actions are local and not saved to the cloud — closing the page resets the setup.
